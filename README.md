# 2D Isometric Turn-Based Demo (Unity)

**Unity / C# / Gameplay / 2D / Turn-Based**  
_This is my first self-driven small demo project, developed through independent learning and AI (ChatGPT)–assisted brainstorming._

---

## Overview
A modest demo showcasing a 2D isometric, turn-based battle loop (player action → enemy response → end-of-turn cleanup) with basic grid feedback (highlighting). This represents my first fully self-built playable prototype.

## Features
- Core turn-based battle system
- Grid movement and range/target highlighting
- Manual control, suitable for demonstrating game logic

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open with **Unity 6000.0.36f1** (or newer)  
3. Load the scene `BattleScene` in `Assets/Scenes` and press **Play**

## Status
- Current state: Core mechanics functional; visuals/UI are placeholder-level; lacks advanced features like multiple unit types or extended narrative.

## Roadmap / Next Steps

### User Interface & Player Guidance
- Add a **Help** dialog explaining basic controls (e.g., “All interactions via mouse-click”)  
- Add a **Settings** menu for adjusting music, brightness, or resolution  
- Add a **Credits** dialog acknowledging tools, inspirations, etc.

### Gameplay & Level Design
- Develop a simple RPG-style world map with multiple locations and NPCs for storyline or side quests  
- Enhance the battle scene with additional unit types: ranged (archers), cavalry, etc.  
- Integrate a tutorial via dialogue/canvas system for new players

### Design Foundation
- Integrate elements from the broader design blueprint (see PDF) as time and scope allow
